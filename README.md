# Moneyball Analysis in R

The purpose of this project is to analyze baseball team data from 1871 to 2006 in order to predict the number of wins that a team will register in a regular season.  

Multiple regression models have been used for the purpose. The models have been generated using variable selections techniques such as **Forward, Backward or Stepwise selection**.  
The best model is selected and further analyzed to see if predictions can be made or not.    
The data was a bit messy so it had to be cleaned first. Some **exploratory analysis** was also done.
